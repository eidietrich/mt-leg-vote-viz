# MT Legislation vis

A tool to visualize votes by the Montana legislature, inspired by Quartz's [Chartbuilder](http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/). Hosted on an in-house server, users can copy information from the state legislative services site and produce html snippets for embedding in story assets.

Input:
- Static data on legislative districts
- Vote data copied manually from mt.leg vote pages

OUTPUT:
- Responsive HTML that can be dropped into a BLOX HTML asset
- AND/OR
- Static version for sharing on social media (#TODO)

Workplan:
- Add export to social-friendly .png?

IDEAS:
- Outline republicans/dems on desktop when you click on votes.
- Or use layout to separate parties
- Graphic display of votes - By district representation (#TODO: Or cartogram)
