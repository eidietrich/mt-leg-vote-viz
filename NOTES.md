# MT Legislation vis

Intent: To create a tool to visualize legislative votes

Form: Web app hosted on github pages or in-house server
Inspired by Quartz's chartbuilder
Code: https://github.com/Quartz/Chartbuilder
Display: http://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/

Input:
- Static data on legislative districts
- Vote data copied manually from mt.leg vote pages

OUTPUT:
- Responsive HTML that can be dropped into a BLOX HTML asset
- AND/OR
- Static version for sharing on social media (#TODO)

Graphic components:
- Graphic headline
- Secondary text
- Total number of Ayes/Nays --> Pass/fail
- Party lines indicator (DEM Ayes/Nays, GOP Ayes/Nays)
- Graphic display of votes - By district representation (#TODO: Or cartogram)

Workplan:
- Add export to social-friendly .png?

IDEAS:
- Outline republicans/dems on desktop when you click on votes.
- Or use layout to separate parties
- On builder: A place to paste in URL for bill page (below cutline)
